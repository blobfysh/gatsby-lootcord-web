You can check your progress towards the next level with the `xp` command. Leveling up will reward you with a crate based on your level and unlock new crafting recipes.

## What's an inactive player?

A player that has not played for more than 2 weeks is considered inactive.

Inactive players are automatically deactivated from all servers to keep the attack pool consisting of active players.

## How can I make all attacks random?

You can force all attacks to be random with the `serversettings` command. Keep in mind you will need the Manage Server permission to modify server settings.

## Can I choose who to attack?

Yes, you can use a weapon to attack a specific player if the server is in selectable attack mode. The attack mode changes on a server by server basis; you can check the current attack mode with the `serversettings` command.

Once enabled, attacking a specific player is as easy as `t-use rock @blobfysh`

If you have the Manage Server permission, you can change the prefix with the `setprefix` command. Example: `t-setprefix .`

## What is a passive shield?

A passive shield is a 24 hour attack shield given to you when you are killed. The passive shield will automatically be removed if you decide to attack someone.
