## How to Craft Items

Before you can craft an item, you should see what materials you'll need to craft it. You can check what an item is crafted with using the `item` command.

The assault\_rifle requires that you are at least level **9** and have 1x metal, 1x metal\_spring and 2x rifle\_body. Once you have these items in your inventory you can craft an assault\_rifle using the `craft` command.
