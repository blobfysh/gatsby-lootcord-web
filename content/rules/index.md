## Rule #1

**Do NOT exploit bugs.**

Bugs, if found, should be reported to the bot moderators by joining the support server and posting in the bug-reports channel. If found to be exploiting bugs, your account data will be reset.

## Rule #2

**Do not use alt or "puppet" accounts.**

The use of secondary accounts operated by you to avoid cooldowns, hoard weapons to avoid loss upon death, organize attacks on a target, farm boxes or in any other way considered unfair to others will result in a warning or in later offenses punishment.

## Rule #3

**Do not leave servers you have just activated in to avoid the deactivate cooldown.**

This is known as cooldown dodging, and is automatically reported to moderators on offense. If you received a warning for this just be aware that after activating in a server, you must wait a bit before being able to use the deactivate command.

## Rule #4

**No kill-farming** - Killing someone then trading items back to the other person in order to gain kill count without consequences.

## Rule #5

**No handouts.**

Giving another player free items/money whether it be through trading, the black market, clans, or kills is not allowed. Doing so will result in a warning or trade ban.

You can deposit an item into the clan vault and let a member withdraw it but if you are found to be abusing this with alt accounts or inviting temporary members to withdraw items/money, you will be trade banned.

## Rule #6

**Do not report without reason.**

The report command should only be used when you have evidence that someone is breaking these rules. Spamming the report command may result in a temporary or permanent ban.
