Items are separated into **7** categories based on their use:

- **Ranged Weapons** - Use ammo to deal damage, have a chance of breaking.
- **Melee Weapons** - No ammo needed, have 100% chance of breaking.
- **Ammunition** - Ammo for ranged weapons.
- **Usable Items** - Items that can be used on yourself. Healing items, armor and crates that you can open are usable items.
- **Storage Containers** - You can `equip` these to increase your inventory space.
- **Resources** - Items that are used to craft other items.
- **Banners** - You can `equip` these to change the look of your `profile`.

There are also **3** tiers:

- **No Tier** - For items not good enough to have a tier ðŸ˜¢
- **Tier 1** - Beginner items, typically won't deal much damage.
- **Tier 2** - Mid-range items, can be efficient time wise but lack damage.
- **Tier 3** - The best items, deal high damage but have a long cooldown.
