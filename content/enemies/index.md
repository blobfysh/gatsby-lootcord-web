Enemy spawns are a [patron-only](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=14199989) feature. These enemies will spawn in a channel where you and your friends can fight them.

Attacking enemies is just like fighting another player, you can use weapons to take down their health until they eventually die. Ex. `t-use crossbow enemy` will shoot the spawned enemy with a crossbow. If the enemy survives your attack, be prepared to take a blow as the enemy will fight you back. **Enemies can kill you, so be careful!**

Most enemies will drop 1 item from the main loot pool + 3 items from the extras loot pool.
