Enemy spawns are a [patron-only](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=14199989) feature. These enemies will spawn in a channel where you and your friends can fight them.

Attacking enemies is just like fighting another player, you can use weapons to take down their health until they eventually die. Ex. `t-use crossbow enemy` will shoot the spawned enemy with a crossbow. If the enemy survives your attack, be prepared to take a blow as the enemy will fight you back. **Enemies can kill you, so be careful!**

Upon death, enemy loot will be given to the top **3** players who dealt the most damage:

- **1st place** - 1 item from main loot pool, 1 item from extras loot pool, kill EXP.
- **2nd place** - 1 item from main loot pool, 1 item from extras loot pool.
- **3rd place** - 1 item from extras loot pool.

The mobs money will be split among the top damage dealers equally.
